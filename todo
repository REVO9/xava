TODO
----

* review window functions for the pre-FFT stage such as:
  * blackman
  * kaiser

* use nix to generate appimages and flatpaks automatically
  - doesn't work atm, check later

* new demo video and/or screenshots

* per-platform new default configs
  - ideally through a default module just like with graphics

* configurable left OR right when in mono
  - debatable use, but sure

* possibility to save settings to config file
  - debatable as I think it will be too much work to support this
  - partial reloads (that don't require reinitializing) should suffice here
    - use ionotify to catch mistakes the user makes instead of crashing outright

* new and nicer README
  - preferrably autogenerated docs
  - configuration options should be documented from the code, not sure how to do
  this in C though (maybe this will require a partial rewrite, again)

* better pipewire support
  - allow users to specify a list of applications that the audio will be recorded of
    (only one at a time unfornately, as I don't want to reinvent The Moon)
  - test and fix loopback

* drop pulseaudio and cubeb support
  - complexity is not what I want and I don't want to support things that are not
  well supported

* move alsa, portaudio, sndio, shmem and fifo into the expert audio category
  - these modules require intimate understanding of how audio systems work and 
  therefore should not be recommended to non-expert users
